# Update 

This is an application created to query websites for their job listings so that I can be notified about these postings more promptly.

I am using the selenium Web driver to accomplish this task since it better handles webpages with dynamic content. 


## Notes
select - finds tag

find - finds class name

# Setup

I have decided to use webdriver manager so I do not have to specify the path to my downloaded webdriver. Webdriver Manger allows for the correct webdriver to be downloaded that matches the Chrome version on the device. 

Selenium Options is used to create a headless browser, meaning tab for Google Chrome won't open

If installing for the first time. Create a virtual environment using requirements.txt
